Senior Year Project from Machine Learning for Economists related to the prediction of C-Sections using various factors

The final paper contains both the report I wrote on the project as well as the script I used for both cleaning and analysis of the data.

The final paper contains a serious error where I failed to analyze a ROC Curve and instead only found TPR and FPR of a single value, but I'm presenting it without edit because it's what I actually did in school, and even upon analyzing the ROC curve, the conclusion that the predictors are inadequate remains unchanged.
